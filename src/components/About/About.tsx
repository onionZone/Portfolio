          I am a frontend developer with over 2 years of&nbsp;experience in that
          field and a deep passion for the IT industry. I started my
          proffesional career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;automation engineer in the
          automotive industry. As someone with an open mind and a quick learning
          ability, I have been able to explore my latent interests in web design
          and modern programming technologies. In private life I'm a huge fan of
          pop culture, delicious cuisine and traveling,
